*********JOIN***************

**************** INNER JOIN *********************
[The INNER JOIN keyword returns only rows with a match in both tables.]
Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

SELECT ProductID, ProductName, CategoryName
FROM Products
INNER JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID;

JOIN and INNER JOIN will return the same result.
 so when you write JOIN the parser actually writes INNER JOIN.

****JOIN THREE TABLES****
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
